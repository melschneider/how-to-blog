# 🚀 Choosing a Visualization Platform for a Scientific Python App  

## **Introduction**  

When developing a **scientific application** as a **computational scientist**, selecting the right **GUI framework or visualization platform** is crucial. The ideal solution should be:  

✅ **Easy to develop** (low complexity, minimal boilerplate).  
✅ **Flexible** (can handle scientific data, visualizations, and user interaction).  
✅ **Scalable** (works for small apps but can be extended).  
✅ **Cross-platform** (should run on Windows, macOS, and Linux).  
✅ **User-friendly** (requires little effort from users).  

Since I needed to integrate **molecular visualizations**, my choice had to support **3D molecular rendering** in a **modern and maintainable way**.

## **🔍 Deployment: Web vs. Local App?**  

One of the first decisions was whether to deploy the app **on a server** (web-based) or as a **local application**. Each option has **trade-offs**:  

### **🌐 Web-Based Deployment (Server)**
✅ **User-friendly**: No installation required.  
✅ **Cross-platform**: Works on any OS with a browser.  
✅ **Easy updates**: The app is updated centrally.  

❌ **Requires maintenance**: Hosting/server setup needed.  
❌ **Potential costs**: Cloud hosting can incur fees.  
❌ **Privacy concerns**: Users must upload data to the server.  

### **💻 Local App Deployment**
✅ **No server required**: Runs locally on the user’s machine.  
✅ **No privacy issues**: Data stays on the user’s device.  
✅ **Potentially faster**: No network latency.  

❌ **User must install the app**.  
❌ **Cross-platform support can be tricky**.  

In my case, **ease of access** was a priority, so I opted for **a web-based deployment using Streamlit**.

## **📊 GUI Framework & Visualization Library Comparison**  

Several **Python-based visualization & GUI options** exist, each with different strengths and weaknesses.  

| **Framework**   | **Pros** | **Cons** |
|---------------|--------|---------|
| **PyQt / PySide** | ✅ Feature-rich | ❌ Complex API |
| | ✅ Desktop application | ❌ Not web-based |
| | ✅ Good for large applications | ❌ GPL-licensed (PyQt) |
| **Dash** | ✅ Web-based | ❌ More complex than Streamlit |
| | ✅ Well-suited for dashboards | ❌ Callbacks can get complicated |
| **Streamlit** | ✅ Very easy to use | ❌ Full script reruns make large apps slow |
| | ✅ Large community support | ❌ Requires workarounds for interactivity |
| | ✅ Many scientific visualization tools |  |
| **Shiny (R & PyShiny)** | ✅ Reactive programming model | ❌ Python version (PyShiny) still new |
| | ✅ Ideal for web apps | ❌ Small Python user base (for now) |
| **Jupyter Notebook** | ✅ Interactive, widely used in research | ❌ Not a standalone GUI framework |
| | ✅ Excellent for prototyping & visualizations | ❌ Limited UI capabilities |

Jupyter Notebook is **great for interactive data exploration**, but it's **not suited for standalone applications**.

## **🎯 Why I Chose Streamlit**  

After evaluating different options, I ultimately chose **Streamlit** for the following reasons:  

### ✅ **Ease of Development**  
Streamlit allows me to build interactive scientific apps **with minimal code**:  

```python
import streamlit as st

st.title("Molecular Visualization App")
st.write("Upload a PDB file to visualize its structure.")

uploaded_file = st.file_uploader("Upload PDB File", type=["pdb"])
```

### ✅ **Large User Base & Community Solutions**  
Streamlit has a **thriving community** that actively contributes:  
- Many **pre-built visualization components**.  
- **Third-party integrations** (e.g., molecular viewers).  
- **Forum support & example repositories**.

## **🌟 Future Possibilities: PyShiny & WebAssembly (WASM)**  

Despite Streamlit’s strengths, **it has a major downside**:  

❌ **Full script reruns can slow down larger apps.**  

**Possible Future Solution?**  
🔹 **PyShiny (Python version of Shiny)** may eventually become a better option for large-scale applications.  
🔹 Currently, **PyShiny’s user base is small**, but as it grows, **more off-the-shelf solutions** will emerge.  

### **🌟 WebAssembly: The Future of Web-Based Python Apps?**  

WebAssembly (WASM) is an exciting **new technology** that allows **running Python apps directly in the browser** without requiring local installation or a backend server.  

Recent WASM-based projects:  
- 🟢 **stlite** (Streamlit compiled to WebAssembly) → [stlite GitHub](https://github.com/whitphx/stlite)  
- 🟢 **PyShiny WebAssembly** → Future support for **running Shiny apps in-browser**.  

#### **🐦 Moorhen: A WebAssembly-Based Molecular Visualization Tool**  

An **exciting example** of WASM in **scientific applications** is **Moorhen**, the WebAssembly-based version of **Coot**, a molecular visualization tool.  
🔗 [Moorhen WebAssembly App](https://moorhen.app/)

**Why is Moorhen exciting?**  
✅ **Runs entirely in the browser** (no installation required).  
✅ **Uses WebGL for 3D molecular visualization**.  
✅ **Ideal for structural biology and macromolecular modeling**.  


🚀 As **WebAssembly adoption grows**, more **scientific visualization tools** will be available **without requiring installation or a dedicated server**. 🚀

## **📌 Conclusion**  

### **How to Choose the Right Visualization Framework?**  

| **Criteria** | **Best Option** |
|-------------|----------------|
| **Fastest to develop** | ✅ **Streamlit** |
| **Large web app (complex interactions)** | ✅ **Dash / PyShiny** |
| **Standalone desktop app** | ✅ **PyQt / PySide** |
| **Scientific research & prototyping** | ✅ **Jupyter Notebook** |
| **Molecular visualization support** | ✅ **Streamlit + `stmol`** |
| **Next-gen in-browser execution** | ✅ **WASM-based tools like Moorhen** |

For my needs, **Streamlit was the best choice**, but **PyShiny + WebAssembly** may be the future!
